Suggestions for improvement of DPPP, LoSoTo and other LOFAR-related software,
as conceived during LiLF development.

DPPP:
- FR solve of some kind

LoSoTo:
- add a norm on the slope (in log space) in the "norm" operation. One should get the slope, then normalize so that it's value is 0.

PiLL:
- Documentation should be written to explain the code structure of PiLF for future developers.
- check fulljones amp
- be sure we use the optimal number of directions (e.g. check the local noise)
- use a larger uvlambdamin in the solve in ddserial
