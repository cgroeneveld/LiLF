=================================

LiLF can be run fully within the LOFAR containers either supplied by LiLF itself (see the docker scripts in the `container <https://github.com/revoltek/LiLF/tree/master/container>_` folder on github or via the default LOFAR containers (`FLoCS<https://github.com/tikk3r/flocs/>_`)
